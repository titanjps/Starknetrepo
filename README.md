# ERC-20 Token Contract in Cairo for Starknet

This is a basic ERC-20 token contract implemented in Cairo for Starknet. ERC-20 is a widely used standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.

## Features

- Supports token transfers between addresses.
- Implements standard ERC-20 functions like `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`, and `transferFrom`.
- Uses the Cairo language for Starknet.

## Getting Started

1. Review the `erc20_token_contract.cairo` file for the contract code.
2. Make sure to adapt the contract to your specific needs and thoroughly test it.
3. Deploy the contract to the Starknet chain.

## Auto Withdraw Script

Included in this repository is a simple auto-withdraw script written in JavaScript. This script periodically checks the balance of a specified contract address and transfers the funds to a target address if a balance is detected.

## Requirements

- Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual contract address, private key, target address, and library (if available).
- Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries for interacting with Starknet contracts.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries or tools.
2. Run the auto-withdraw script periodically using a task scheduler or any other preferred method.
